# Task: Materials Prep (Workstream 4 — Fundraising & Partnerships)

Timeframe: January → March

## Goal

Prepare fundraising and partnership materials that reflect the current product, validation evidence, and execution plan.

## Inputs

- Pitch deck feedback received Jan 6 (Ihab + Aladin); technical deck forwarded to Asif
- Free-tier product boundary and demo readiness (Workstream 2 / Workstream 1)
- Validation case studies (Workstream 3)
- MII mid-term artifacts (Workstream 1)

## Deliverables

- Updated pitch narrative and deck sections incorporating feedback
- Pilot proposal template (scope, success criteria, timeline)
- A “proof points” bundle (demo link/video, benchmark plan, validation plots)

## Milestones / Steps

- Consolidate and implement received feedback; version the deck
- Produce a clean, consistent set of validation slides (importable into the deck)
- Align messaging: what is real today vs what is planned (avoid overpromising)
