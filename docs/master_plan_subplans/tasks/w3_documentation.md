# Task: Documentation (Workstream 3 — Validation Studies)

Timeframe: March (and maintained through May as materials evolve)

## Goal

Ship slide-ready, reusable validation artifacts for partnerships/fundraising and keep them aligned with the current product/pipeline.

## Deliverables

- One-page writeup per case study (problem → method → result → implication)
- Slide-ready assets (figures + concise bullets) that can be dropped into a deck
- Reproducibility notes (how to regenerate figures; data provenance; version tags)

## Notes

These artifacts are explicit prerequisites for Workstream 4 outreach and pilot proposals.
