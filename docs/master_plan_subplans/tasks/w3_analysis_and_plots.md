# Task: Analysis & Plots (Workstream 3 — Validation Studies)

Timeframe: February → March

## Goal

Run analyses and generate plots that clearly demonstrate the “prediction → experiment” loop and support outbound/pilot conversations.

## Inputs

- Locked case study scope + input datasets (from January)
- Stable predictor behavior and versioned settings (coordinate with Workstream 1/2 to avoid churn)

## Deliverables

- Final plots for each case study (slide-quality, with captions/interpretation)
- A short narrative per plot: what it shows, why it matters, and what a partner should infer

## Milestones / Steps

- Run initial analysis pass; verify key conclusions are robust
- Iterate plots for clarity and consistency (shared styles, common metrics)
- Prepare “talk track” notes to reuse in fundraising/pilot meetings
