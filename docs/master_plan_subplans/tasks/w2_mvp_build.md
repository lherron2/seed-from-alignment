# Task: MVP Build (Workstream 2 — RNAnneal Free Tier)

Timeframe: January → early February

## Goal

Define and implement the minimum viable free-tier product boundaries so a soft launch is feasible and support load is bounded.

## Inputs

- Cloud deployment baseline from Workstream 1
- Product constraints (compute budget, queueing limits, acceptable latency)
- Draft data policy requirements

## Deliverables

- MVP scope spec: sequence limits, presets, queue behavior, retention policy, guardrails
- Landing page copy (clear expectations + limitations)
- Data policy draft (storage/retention/privacy)
- Baseline observability plan ready for soft launch

## Milestones / Steps

- Decide hard limits and operational guardrails first (avoid unlimited usage by default)
- Define a small set of presets rather than a complex configuration surface
- Implement queue/limits + retention handling
- Prepare onboarding and user support workflow for the soft launch cohort
