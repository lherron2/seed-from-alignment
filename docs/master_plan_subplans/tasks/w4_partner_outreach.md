# Task: Partner Outreach (Workstream 4 — Fundraising & Partnerships)

Timeframe: March → April (with May–June follow-through)

## Goal

Convert validation and product artifacts into pilot conversations and secure 1–2 signed pilot agreements.

## Inputs

- Outbound target list (5–10 targets) derived from validation stories (March)
- Pilot proposal template + internal criteria for “good pilot” vs time sink
- Proof points bundle (demo, validation, benchmark plan/results as available)

## Deliverables

- Outreach tracking (targets, status, next actions)
- At least one signed pilot by April with defined scope and timeline
- Post-pilot plan: how pilot results feed raise narrative (May–June)

## Milestones / Steps

- March: build target list and tailored outreach notes per target
- Run structured calls: problem discovery → pilot pitch → scoping → terms → signature
- April: focus on closing a pilot rather than expanding target count
