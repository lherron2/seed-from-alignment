# Task: Mid-term Prep (Workstream 1 — MII Grant)

Timeframe: January → mid-term presentation (Feb 16–20)

## Goal

Deliver a live cloud demo + benchmark plan at the MII mid-term without depending on experimental eSHAPE results.

## Inputs

- Stable cloud deployment (URL + authentication/limits as needed)
- Draft benchmark plan: RNA target list (96), batching plan, scoring approach, risk register
- EclipseBio quote/contract status and expected data timeline
- Preliminary scoring results using existing public SHAPE data (if needed as a stand-in)

## Deliverables

- Live demo (primary) + fallback walkthrough video + screenshots (backup plan)
- Mid-term slide deck (demo narrative + benchmark plan + risks + timeline)
- Written benchmark plan (shareable appendix)

## Milestones / Steps

- Define the live demo scope (what is shown, success criteria, failure handling)
- Stabilize demo environment and run it end-to-end repeatedly
- Enumerate failure modes + mitigations (timeouts, queue overload, tool failures, weird inputs)
- Create a “mid-term package” folder: slides, demo script, benchmark plan, risk register
- Rehearse with a strict checklist; lock a final build/tagged deployment for the presentation

## Risks & Mitigations (from master plan)

- If cloud demo is brittle: rely on recorded walkthrough + screenshots; optimize for reliability over features.
- If EclipseBio slips: present as “experiment underway”; focus mid-term on demo + plan + public-data preliminary scoring.

## Near-term Actions (Next 6 Weeks)

- Weeks 1–2: EclipseBio meeting + quote; stabilize cloud URL; finalize RNA list + batching; define live mid-term demo.
- Weeks 3–4: draft mid-term slides; run demo end-to-end incl failure modes.
- Week 5: mid-term rehearsal + backup assets (video/screenshots).
- Week 6: deliver mid-term; convert feedback into March–June checklist.
