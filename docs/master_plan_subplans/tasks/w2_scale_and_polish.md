# Task: Scale & Polish (Workstream 2 — RNAnneal Free Tier)

Timeframe: March → May

## Goal

Improve throughput, cost controls, and UX polish to sustain ongoing usage, while clarifying requirements for a paid tier.

## Inputs

- Usage telemetry and failure taxonomy from soft launch
- Compute/cost constraints and infrastructure bottlenecks
- User feedback (what they try to do vs what is supported)

## Deliverables

- Throughput improvements + cost controls (quotas, queue discipline, batching)
- Reduced operational burden (automated checks, clearer errors, runbooks)
- Basic UX polish driven by the highest-volume pain points
- Paid tier requirements list + assumptions for pricing/positioning

## Milestones / Steps

- Monthly reliability targets (SLO-like) for job completion rate and median turnaround
- Implement cost controls before adding features
- Convert repeated support issues into product/UX changes
