# Task: Case Study Selection (Workstream 3 — Validation Studies)

Timeframe: January

## Goal

Finalize 2 (optionally 3) validation case studies and gather all required inputs so analysis can run without thrash.

Selected case studies (from master plan):

- Braselmann Mutant Dataset — riboswitch validation
- Broccoli — temperature robustness

## Deliverables

- Locked scope for each case study (question, dataset, comparison baseline, outputs)
- Input data gathered and documented (provenance + preprocessing notes)
- Analysis plan per case study (what plots, what claims, what success criteria)
