# Task: Final Report (Workstream 1 — MII Grant)

Deadline: June 30 (MII final report due)

## Goal

Submit the MII final report and deliverables package by June 30, using benchmark results and analysis produced in Workstream 1.

## Inputs

- Benchmark results + analysis artifacts (April–May)
- Mid-term feedback and any required deliverable format constraints
- Documentation of methods, limitations, and reproducibility steps

## Deliverables

- Final report (complete narrative + methods + results + risks/limitations)
- Deliverables package (data/plots/tables, reproducibility notes, and any required links/artifacts)

## Milestones / Steps

- April: start report drafting early (methods + benchmark definition + planned structure)
- May: incorporate finalized benchmark results and M1/M2 analysis; internal review
- June: finalize narrative, polish figures/tables, compile deliverables, and submit by June 30

## Risks & Mitigations

- End-loaded writing risk: keep a continuously updated report draft starting in April.
- Late-breaking pipeline changes: enforce a freeze window and document any changes as explicit deltas.
