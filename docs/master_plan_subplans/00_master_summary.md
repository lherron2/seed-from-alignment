# Master Summary (Jan–Jun 2026)

Based on the master plan PDF: `docs/master_plan_subplans/Master_Timeline_Jan_Jun_2026_v2.docx.pdf` (copied from `/home/lukas/master-plan/Master_Timeline_Jan_Jun_2026_v2.docx.pdf`).

## Critical Dates (from the master plan)

- Feb 16–20: MII mid-term presentation
- Feb 24–28 or Mar 3–7: PhD thesis defense target window
- Mar 15–Apr 15: EclipseBio eSHAPE data expected
- June 30: MII final report due

## Workstreams (6)

1. **MII Grant (RNAnneal + eSHAPE Benchmark)** — mid-term demo (Feb) → full benchmark + final report (June 30)
2. **RNAnneal Free Tier Launch** — MVP build → soft launch → scale/polish
3. **Validation Case Studies** — 2–3 slide-ready “prediction → experiment” stories
4. **Fundraising & Partnerships** — raise strategy + 1–2 pilot agreements (depends on #2 + #3)
5. **PhD Thesis Defense** — preprint → committee scheduling → defense
6. **ARPA-H (Contingency)** — conditional reprioritization if award arrives

## Key Sequencing / Dependencies

- **MII grant deliverables are first priority**; they drive fixed deadlines (mid-term, June 30 final report).
- **Fundraising/partnerships (Workstream 4)** depends on:
  - A usable cloud product in real users’ hands (Workstream 2)
  - 1–2 compelling validation case studies (Workstream 3)
  - A credible execution plan (Workstream 1 + 2)
- **Thesis defense scheduling** is explicitly coupled to preprint posting: committee outreach is triggered immediately upon arXiv posting.

## Resolved planning contradictions (from the master plan)

- **Defense timing**: targeted to Feb 24–28 or Mar 3–7 (not “Q2 sometime”).
- **Preprint → committee**: preprint submission prioritized early-to-mid Feb; committee outreach drafted in advance and sent same day as posting; defense target 2–3 weeks after posting.
- **EclipseBio vs mid-term**: mid-term should not require experimental eSHAPE results; focus on demo + benchmark plan + contract status + preliminary scoring from public SHAPE data.

## Pre-decided contingency responses

- If **ARPA-H award** arrives: within 2 weeks, pause all non-deadline work (except MII) and produce staffing/time allocation, kickoff plan, updated budget/timeline, and scope split vs RNAnneal free-tier/validation.
- If **EclipseBio slips** relative to mid-term: treat mid-term as “experiment underway”; ensure demo + benchmark plan + preliminary scoring are strong; present clear expected timeline for data arrival.
- If **cloud demo is brittle**: record a clean walkthrough video and keep screenshots; optimize for reliability over features.
- If **defense can’t be scheduled in Feb/Mar**: push to early April (Week 14–15) to preserve buffer before MII final report push.

## “Near-Term Actions (Next 6 Weeks)” (copied into task subplans where relevant)

- Weeks 1–2 (“Now”): EclipseBio meeting/quote; stabilize cloud URL; finalize RNA list + batching; define live mid-term demo; keep editing manuscript.
- Weeks 3–4: draft mid-term slides; run demo end-to-end incl failure modes; free-tier MVP decisions; implement pitch deck feedback.
- Week 5: mid-term rehearsal + backup (video/screenshots); finalize preprint checklist; submit preprint; draft committee outreach emails.
- Week 6 (Mid-term): deliver MII mid-term; on posting send committee emails same day; convert feedback into revised March–June checklist.
