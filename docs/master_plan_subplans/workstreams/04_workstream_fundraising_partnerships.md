# Workstream 4 — Fundraising & Partnerships

Owner(s): Lukas + Emergente co-founders

Definition of Done (from master plan): finalized raise strategy; 1–2 signed pilot agreements.

Prerequisites (from master plan): cloud product in users’ hands; 1–2 compelling validation stories; credible execution plan.

## Outcomes / Deliverables

- Raise strategy document: target investor profile, narrative, milestones, and timing
- Updated pitch materials incorporating received feedback (Ihab + Aladin; technical deck forwarded to Asif)
- Pilot proposal template: scope, success criteria, timeline, pricing/terms (as applicable)
- Outbound list (5–10 targets) + structured outreach tracking
- 1–2 signed pilot agreements (target: at least one by April)

## Timeline (from master plan, expanded)

### March
- Translate validation artifacts into 5–10 outbound targets
- Develop pilot proposals and outreach materials

### April
- Aim for one signed pilot with defined scope and timeline

### May–June
- Finalize raise narrative
- Use MII/validation artifacts as proof points (demo, benchmark plan/results, case studies)

## Dependencies

- Workstream 2: free-tier product in users’ hands (credibility + references)
- Workstream 3: validation stories that demonstrate “prediction → experiment” loop
- Workstream 1: MII mid-term and benchmark artifacts as proof points

## Risks & Mitigations

- Insufficient proof points by March: bias toward shipping “good enough” validation stories and a stable demo rather than feature expansion.
- Partner-specific requirements cause thrash: enforce a standard pilot scope and defer bespoke asks unless they lead directly to signature.
