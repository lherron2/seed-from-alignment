# Workstream 3 — Validation Case Studies

Owner(s): Lukas

Definition of Done (from master plan): 2–3 tight stories with plots demonstrating the “prediction → experiment” loop; slide-ready materials.

Selected case studies (from master plan):

1. Braselmann Mutant Dataset — riboswitch validation
2. Broccoli — temperature robustness

## Outcomes / Deliverables

- For each case study:
  - Reproducible analysis notebook/script pipeline
  - Final plots (publication/slide quality)
  - One-page writeup (problem → method → result → implication)
- A combined slide-ready “validation” deck section usable for fundraising/pilots

## Timeline (from master plan, expanded)

### January (Selection + inputs)
- Finalize case study selection (lock scope; avoid adding more)
- Gather all input data and document provenance (datasets, versions, preprocessing)

### February–March (Analysis + plots + narrative)
- Run analyses end-to-end; validate robustness to parameter choices
- Generate plots; iterate narrative until it supports outbound/pilot conversations
- Ship at least two slide-ready stories + one-page writeups

## Dependencies

- Predictor output must be stable enough to avoid churn in “final” plots (coordinate with Workstream 1/2 changes).
- Outputs feed Workstream 4 (fundraising/pilots) and should be timed to support March outreach.

## Risks & Mitigations

- Scope creep: keep to the two selected studies; add a third only if it is clearly lower-effort and higher-leverage.
- Narrative mismatch: keep the “so what” tied to concrete decision-making (what experiment to run / what changes a partner would make).
