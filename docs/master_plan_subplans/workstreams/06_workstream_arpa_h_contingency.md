# Workstream 6 — ARPA-H (Contingency)

Owner(s): Lukas (primary) + relevant collaborators if selected

Status (from master plan): proposal submitted; awaiting feedback.

## Decision branches (from master plan)

### If selected
- Within 2 weeks, pause all non-deadline work (except MII) and produce:
  1. Staffing / time allocation plan
  2. Partner kickoff plan
  3. Updated budget + timeline
  4. Clear scope split between ARPA-H deliverables and RNAnneal free-tier / validation roadmap

### If not selected
- Recycle proposal into investor collateral
- Focus on MII + partner pilots

## Outputs to prepare proactively (low-effort, high-leverage)

- A “ready to execute in 2 weeks” checklist with owners and templates for the 4 required artifacts
- A lightweight scope-split rubric so MII work continues uninterrupted
