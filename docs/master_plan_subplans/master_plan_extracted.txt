Emergente & PhD Master Plan  |  Jan–Jun 2026 

Master Timeline: January – June 2026 

Coordinating PhD Defense, MII Deliverables, and Emergente Launch 

Executive Summary 

This document orchestrates work across six parallel workstreams for the next six months. The 
plan prioritizes deadline-driven commitments (MII grant) first, then activities that unlock 
fundraising and partnerships (cloud product and validation case studies), while maintaining a 
realistic workload with few parallel major initiatives at any given time. 

Critical Dates: 

Feb 16–20: MII Mid-term Presentation 
Feb 24–28 or Mar 3–7: PhD Thesis Defense (Target Window) 
Mar 15–Apr 15: EclipseBio eSHAPE Data Expected 
June 30: MII Final Report Due

Contradictions Identified & Resolved 

During the review of planning documents and journal notes, the following inconsistencies were 
identified and resolved: 

1. PhD Defense Timeline 

Contradiction: The master plan document states "PhD Thesis (Q2 2026 defense target)" which 
implies April–June. However, journal notes from January 7, 2026 state: "Goal is to schedule the 
defense for the last week of February or the first week of March." 

Resolution: Adopting the more recent and specific target from journal notes. The defense 
window is now targeted for February 24–28 or March 3–7, 2026. This aligns with stated intent 
and creates a more aggressive but achievable timeline. 

2. Preprint-to-Committee Timing 

Contradiction: The master plan says to "post RNAnneal preprint" and "send committee 
scheduling emails" both in February. Journal notes state: "Will delay reaching out to [committee] 
until RNAnneal preprint is available online." This creates a compressed window if both must 
happen in February with defense in late Feb/early March. 

Resolution: Preprint submission should be prioritized in early-to-mid February (weeks 5–6). 
Committee outreach emails should be drafted and ready to send immediately upon arXiv 
posting (same day). Defense scheduling should target 2–3 weeks post-preprint. If preprint posts 
by Feb 14, defense can realistically occur March 3–7. 

3. EclipseBio Data vs. MII Mid-term 

Potential Issue: The plan acknowledges EclipseBio data may slip relative to mid-term, but lists 
"preliminary scoring metrics" as a mid-term deliverable. If samples haven't been submitted yet, 
6–8 weeks puts data arrival in mid-March at earliest. 

Resolution: Mid-term presentation should focus on: (1) live cloud demo, (2) benchmark plan 
with RNA target list, (3) contract/quote status with EclipseBio, and (4) preliminary scoring using 
existing public SHAPE data. Label experimental eSHAPE results as "in progress" with clear 
timeline.

Workstream Details 

■ Workstream 1: MII Grant (RNAnneal + eSHAPE Benchmark) 

Owner: Lukas (primary), with Nadia supporting cloud infrastructure 
Definition of Done: Mid-term demo in February; full 96-RNA benchmark with eSHAPE data + 
final report by June 30. 

• 
January: Finalize RNA target list + batching plan; initiate EclipseBio contract/quote 
($4,000 via AWS); stabilize cloud deployment 

• 
February: Deliver live cloud demo + benchmark plan at mid-term; submit sequences to 
EclipseBio; document risks 

• 
March: Integrate EclipseBio data when it arrives; expand benchmark; formalize API 
endpoints and documentation 

• 
April–May: Run benchmark at scale; iterate scoring model; complete M1/M2 analysis; 
write final report 

• 
June: Submit final report and deliverables by June 30 

■ Workstream 2: RNAnneal Free Tier Launch 

Owner: Lukas (product), Nadia (infrastructure) 
Definition of Done: Soft-launch to 10–20 labs; stable operations with limits, landing page, and 
repeatable pipeline. 

• 
January: Define MVP scope (sequence limit, presets, queue); draft data policy; create 
landing page copy 

• 
February: Soft launch to friendly labs; start collecting jobs; implement observability (logs, 
failures, runtime)

March–May: Improve throughput and cost controls; add basic UX polish; identify paid tier 
requirements 

■ Workstream 3: Validation Case Studies 

Owner: Lukas

slide-ready materials. 
Selected Case Studies: (1) Braselmann Mutant Dataset – riboswitch validation; (2) Broccoli 
Temperature Robustness 

• 
January: Finalize case study selection; gather input data 

• 
February–March: Run analyses; generate plots; ship two slide-ready stories with

Emergente & PhD Master Plan  |  Jan–Jun 2026 

• 
April: Aim for one signed pilot with defined scope and timeline 

• 
May–June: Finalize raise narrative; use MII/validation artifacts as proof points 

Note: Received pitch deck feedback from Ihab and Aladin (Jan 6). Action: combine and 
implement. Technical deck forwarded to Asif. 

■ Workstream 5: PhD Thesis Defense

• 
Upon Posting: Send committee emails same day; lock defense window 

■ Workstream 6: ARPA-H (Contingency) 

Status: Proposal submitted; awaiting feedback. 
If Selected: Within 2 weeks, pause non-deadline work; produce staffing plan, partner kickoff, 
updated budget, scope split. 
If Not Selected: Recycle into investor collateral; focus on MII + partner pilots.

• Implement Ihab + Aladin pitch deck feedback 

Week 5 
• Mid-term rehearsal + backup plan (screenshots/video); finalize preprint 
submission checklist 
• Submit RNAnneal preprint to arXiv; draft committee outreach emails 

Week 6 (Mid-term) 
• Deliver MII mid-term presentation 
• Upon preprint posting: Send committee emails same day; lock defense 
window 
• Convert feedback into revised March–June checklist

Contingency Plans 

Pre-decided responses to enable rapid action without re-planning: 

If ARPA-H award comes in: 

Within 2 weeks, pause all non-deadline work (except MII) and produce: (1) staffing/time 
allocation, (2) partner kickoff plan, (3) updated budget + timeline, (4) clear scope split between 
ARPA-H deliverables and RNAnneal free-tier/validation roadmap. 

If EclipseBio slips relative to mid-term: 

Treat mid-term as "experiment underway"; ensure the demo + benchmark plan + preliminary 
scoring results (from public SHAPE data) are strong enough to carry the meeting. Present clear 
timeline for when experimental data will arrive. 

If cloud demo is brittle: 

Record a clean walkthrough video and keep screenshots as fallback. Aim for "boring reliability" 
over features. 

If thesis defense cannot be scheduled in Feb/Mar: 

Push to early April (Week 14–15). This provides buffer before MII final report push while still 
achieving Q2 defense.
